Movies Booking Portal

We have used Spring Tool Suite (STS) and Visual Studio Code for making this project.
Customers can book tickets for their favorite movies very seamlessly using our user friendly UI and can also pay securely with Paytm Payment Gateway.
We also have admin portal where details about the  movies, theater and customers can be accessed.
